        <h1>How does browser handles javacript ?</h1>
    </section>

        <p>Javascript works in client side that means it runs inside browser.What is that one thing that allows javascript to work inside browser ? The answer is <u>Javascript engine.</u></p>

        <h2>Little history about javascript engine :-</h2>
        <p>The first developers of javascript is netscape.They were also the developer of javascript engine as well.Now netscape is converted to mozilla and now the engine is recognised as <u>spider monkey.</u>Spider monkey engine is to render javascript in mozilla firefox.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the javasript engine for chrome is <u>V8 engine</u>.For microsoft edge, the javascript engine is known as <u>chakra</u>Though these javascript engines have different names, they all render javascript and work in similar pattern.</p>

        <p>Here is a list of javascript engines for different browsers.</p>
        <p class="code">API stands for <b>Application Programming Interface.</b></p>

        <h2>How does these javascript engine work?</h2>

        <p>We use a script tag while writing a javascript code.With the help of this script tag, the javascript code is fetched.The javsacript code can be fetched primarily from 3 resources.These are <u>network, cache and service worker.</u></p>

        <p>Network --> Javascript code is stored in a server where the website is uploaded.When the user access a website, the javasript code is fetched from network.When the user visits a website for the first time , then network is used.</p>

        <p>Cache --> When a user visits a website multiple times, the javascript code gets store in cache memory in user's computer.When the user visits the website again , javasript is fetched from cache.</p>

        <h2>What happens after javasript is fethed?</h2>
        <p>One the javasript code is fethed from either network or cache, it gets downloaded is form of bytes.</p>

        <p>This binary data gets decoded with the help of <u>byte stream decoder</u>The byte stream decoder decodes byte into <u>tokens.</u>The tokens are sent to <u>parser.</u></p>

        <h2>What are the types of parsers?</h2>

        <p> There are basically 2 types of parsers in any type of javascript engine.</p>

        <p>1) Pre-parser --> It parses all the unecessary code that is not needed immideately for execution.</p>

        <p>2) Parser --> It parses all the useful code that is needed immideately for execution.This significantly improves the rendering time and this makes javascript super fast.</p>
