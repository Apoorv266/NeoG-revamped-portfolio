        <h1>How does the browser handle JavaScript?</h1>
    </section>

    <section class="center">


        <p>Javascript works on the client side which means it runs inside the browser. What is that one thing that allows javascript to work inside the browser? The answer is the<u>Javascript engine.</u></p>

        <h2>A little history about javascript engine:-</h2>
        <p>The first developer of javascript is Netscape. They were also the developer of the javascript engine as well. Now Netscape is converted to Mozilla and now the engine is recognized as a <u>spider monkey</u> . Spider monkey engine is to render javascript in Mozilla firefox.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the javascript engine for chrome is a <u>V8 engine</u> . For Microsoft edge, the javascript engine is known as <u>chakra</u> .Though these javascript engines have different names, they all render javascript and work in a similar pattern.</p>

        <p>Here is a list of javascript engines for different browsers.</p>
        <p class="code">API stands for <b>Application Programming Interface.</b></p>

        <h2>How does these javascript engines work?</h2>

        <p>We use a script tag while writing a javascript code.With the help of this script tag, the javascript code is fetched.The javsacript code can be fetched primarily from 3 resources.These are <u>network, cache and service worker.</u></p>

        <p>Network --> Javascript code is stored in a server where the website is uploaded.When the user access a website, the javasript code is fetched from network.When the user visits a website for the first time , then network is used.</p>

        <p>Cache --> When a user visits a website multiple times, the javascript code gets store in cache memory in user's computer.When the user visits the website again , javasript is fetched from cache.</p>

        <h2>What happens after javasript is fethed?</h2>
        <p>One the javasript code is fethed from either network or cache, it gets downloaded is form of bytes.</p>

        <p>This binary data gets decoded with the help of <u>byte stream decoder</u>The byte stream decoder decodes byte into <u>tokens.</u>The tokens are sent to <u>parser.</u></p>

        <h2>What are the types of parsers?</h2>

        <p> There are basically 2 types of parsers in any type of javascript engine.</p>

        <p>1) Pre-parser --> It parses all the unecessary code that is not needed immideately for execution.</p>

        <p>2) Parser --> It parses all the useful code that is needed immideately for execution.This significantly improves the rendering time and this makes javascript super fast.</p>

        <h2>What happens after parsing?</h2>

<p>A node is created as the parsing happens based upon the tokens that has been passed to the parser by byte stream decoder.A node looks like a tree like structure similar to DOM tree.This tree is known as <u>abstract syntax tree or AST.</u></p>

<p>The <u>interpreter</u> walks through the AST and generates byte code.This byte code is send to <u>optimizing compailer</u>which generates highly optimized machine code with is finally userstood by our browsers.</p>
